# Hello, Kendra!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Kendra!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-kendra) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Kendra and enterprise search. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Kendra and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to perform enterprise search with machine learning. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Kendra Project

We will first create a Kendra index of S3 documents, using public-domain physics papers from Project Gutenberg. After testing search in the AWS console, we'll create a .NET Web API project that processes searches with Kendra using the AWS SDK for .NET. 

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
